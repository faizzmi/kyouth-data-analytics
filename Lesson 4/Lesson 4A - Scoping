Problem Statement:

Hana Mohana, Owner of Suria Restaurant
We've seen some patterns in what sells depending on the day or the weather,     --point 1
but it's hard to explain why.
We're also not sure who our loyal customers are or what keeps them coming back.  --point 2

We want to use data to uncover those insights and make better decisions about
our menu and how we serve our customers, so we can grow the business in a more
focused and informed way.
